I have created a folder called "Documentation". In that folder, you are to create markdown documentations of every feature of the webapp's page(including the programminglanguages used there, what features were implemented in that page, what tools/dependencies were used/installed to implement these features, what algorithms exists in that page, and the security measures in place(do not include security lackings) inside that page).
